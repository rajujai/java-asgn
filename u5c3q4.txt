IOC => IoC container is responsible to instantiate, configure and assemble the objects
The IoC container get informations from the xml file and inject the dependencies into 
java bean object.

Spring Beans => Spring bean are the POJO or POJI class of java which is managed by 
IoC container.

Autowiring => In spring IoC, we can make automate the dependency injection by autowiring
it is of 3 types for setter
default : no
byName 
byType

and for constructor default is byName if not found then byType

Limitations of autowiring => If we have no of beans with same type then autowire will 
not work in this case beacuse of duplicates according to byType
